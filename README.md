# Smart-Brain

A face tracking website that uses Clarifai to locate faces in an uploaded photo.

Make sure to run npm install before trying anything because I have not included the node modules folder.

To start:
1. Open a terminal and cd into 'smart-brain-api' and run npm install and npm start
2. Open another terminal 
3. cd into 'smart-brain' and run npm install and npm start
